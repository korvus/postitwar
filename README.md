Postitwar.me
============

This project is a little website trying to convert an uploaded picture to a postit grid.
It's 33% HTML, 33% Javascript, 33% PHP (eaaaark.), the 1% left is this README :-).

It's far from being perfect, being totally focused on the machine the website will run on.
However, excepted some hardcoded absolute links and a lot of PHP warning, it could work on any other webserver since we don't use anything fancy.

You was used to test it on http://postitwar.me, but sadly since 3M company have complained about this use, site have been shut down.

So feel free to use it in the way you want.
